#   Introduction to Shell üêö Scripting

- The shell is a program that gives the client a point of interaction to utilize the working framework's capacities through certain orders. A shell script is a program that is utilized to perform explicit assignments.

- Shell scripts are generally used to stay away from dreary work.

- You can write a script to automate a set of instructions to be executed one after the other consistently, instead of typing in the commands one after the other N number of times.



#  So what is this repo all about then?

- In this repo, we'll go through the certain basic orders for BASH (Bourne Again SHell), which is the most broadly involved shell and furthermore the default in most Linux frameworks, which most servers use as their working framework. Shell is like any other programming language and can be used to help you in any way you like, but it takes dedication to achieve something truly spectacular. Take your time to explore these basic to increasingly complex scripts to broaden your mind, and most importanlty, have fun doing it!

- Oh, and be sure to run your scripts with 'bash yourscriptname.sh' in the terminal! üñ•Ô∏è
